<img align="right" height="30" src="http://www.srgssr.ch/fileadmin/templates/images/SRGLogo.gif">

> A boilerplate project to get started with WebdriverIO

### Overview

This project is an example of how to get started using WebdriverIO for Selenium testing using node.js. It makes use of Jasmine framework, runs with spec and junit reporters, browserstack service, selenium-standalone service (for development) and uses Grunt to manage tasks.

### Setup

Run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies. To make use of the grunt's tasks by command line, install `grunt-cli` globally:

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Additionaly you have to set your username and access key for Browserstack as environment varaibles:

```sh
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="username"
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

### Configuration

The main configuration file is `./conf/wdio.conf.js`. This file contains all configuration parameters that are common to every environment. We've also set up three additional environment files as an example:

```
./conf/wdio.dev.conf.js  # Dev - Uses selenium-standalone
./conf/wdio.test.conf.js # Test
./conf/wdio.tage.conf.js # Stage
./conf/wdio.prod.conf.js # Prod
```

Use these files to override the main configuration for specific configuration parameters (e.g. changing the baseUrl of your tests). You can also add new environments in the `Gruntfile.js`.

### Run

The `Gruntfile.js` contains a task for each environemnet configuration, you can run them with the following commands:

```sh
grunt dev   # Run dev profile
grunt test  # Run test profile
grunt stage # Run stage profile
grunt prod  # Run prod profile
grunt       # Run dev profile
```

If you add new environment configurations you'll need to create the tasks as well in your `Gruntfile.js`.
