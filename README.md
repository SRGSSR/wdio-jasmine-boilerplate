### Setup

Run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies. To make use of the grunt tasks by command line, install `grunt-cli` globally:

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Additionaly you have to set your username and access key for Browserstack as environment varaibles:

```sh
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="username"
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

### Configuration

The main configuration file is ``./conf/wdio.conf.js`. This file contains all configurations that are common to every environment. We've also set up three additional environment files: test, stage and prod:

```
./conf/wdio.test.conf.js # Test
./conf/wdio.tage.conf.js # Stage
./conf/wdio.prod.conf.js # Prod
```

Use this files to override the main configuration for specific configuration parameters of the different environments. You can also add new environments in the `Gruntfile.js`.

### Run

The `Gruntfile.js` contains a task for each environemnet, you can run them through the following commands:

```sh
grunt test  # Run test profile
grunt stage # Run stage profile
grunt prod  # Run prod profile
grunt       # Run prod profile
```
